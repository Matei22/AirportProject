Airport Project
I used 3 sprints for completing this application:
1.	First I built the tables and inserted the data into them using java applications.
2.	In the second sprint I built the workflow using jsp pages
3.	In the third sprint I connected the jsp pages and the tables in the databases using sql tags and useBean.

The core concept I used are:  variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.

Implicit Objects like response, request, page, session.

Directives and descriptions like <%page…%>, <% include …%>, <%taglib…%>.

Attribute of JSP Page Directive like import, errorPage, session. JSP Action tags like <jsp:include page=”…”/>, <jsp:useBean id=””, scope=””, class=””, type=””, beanName=””>, <jsp:getPoperty name=”” property=””>. 

JSTL: SQL tags
